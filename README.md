# Skin Cancer Class | Transfer Learning | XAI

This repository contains python codes and documentations for the project - "Empirical analysis of CNN & Transfer Learning Models with focus on Explainable AI techniques for 
interpretable Skin Cancer Classification". This project compared traditional CNN models with advanced transfer learning models such as EfficientNet_B0, EfficientNet_v2_B0, 
ResNet50, VGG16, and Vision Transformers. Further few Explainable AI like GRAD-CAM, LIME and Attention mapping on baseline CNN model and best performer - Vision Transformer model.

### Implementation


#### Load data. EDA and pre-processing


#### Training-testing models and implementing XAI methods
